# FalconXDR Driver Integration

## Overview
This document describes the integration between the FalconXDR user-mode application and the XDR kernel driver. The integration enables real-time kernel-level telemetry collection including process creation, process exit, DLL/image loading, and suspicious handle operations.

## Architecture

### Components

#### 1. Kernel Driver (`driver/XdrDriver.c`)
- **Location**: `driver/XdrDriver.c` and `driver/XdrDriverShared.h`
- **Purpose**: Kernel-mode driver that monitors system events
- **Device Name**: `\Device\XDR`
- **Symbolic Link**: `\\.\XDR` (user-mode), `\??\XDR` (kernel-mode)
- **Communication Method**: IOCTL-based polling

**Monitored Events:**
- Process creation/exit (via `PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx`)
- DLL/Image loading (via `PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine`)
- Suspicious handle operations on LSASS (via `ObRegisterCallbacks`)

#### 2. User-Mode Driver Manager (`XDR/DriverManager.h`)
- **Location**: `XDR/DriverManager.h`
- **Purpose**: User-mode component that communicates with the kernel driver
- **Implementation**: Header-only class with background polling thread
- **Event Processing**: Formats kernel events for UI display

### Communication Protocol

#### IOCTL Code
```cpp
#define IOCTL_XDR_GET_EVENTS CTL_CODE(FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN, 0x801, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_ANY_ACCESS)
```

#### Event Structure
```cpp
struct XDR_DRIVER_EVENT {
    uint32_t Type;        // Event type (1=ProcCreate, 2=ProcExit, 3=ImageLoad, 4=SuspiciousHandle)
    uint32_t Pid;         // Process ID
    uint32_t ParentPid;   // Parent PID (for create events)
    uint32_t Reserved;    // Alignment/future use
    uint64_t Time100ns;   // System time from KeQuerySystemTimePrecise
    uint64_t Arg1;        // Context-dependent (base address, target PID, etc.)
    uint64_t Arg2;        // Context-dependent (size, access mask, etc.)
    wchar_t  Path[260];   // Image/DLL path (NT-style)
};
```

#### Event Types
| Type | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `XDR_EVT_PROC_CREATE` | 1 | Process creation |
| `XDR_EVT_PROC_EXIT` | 2 | Process termination |
| `XDR_EVT_IMAGE_LOAD` | 3 | DLL/Image loaded into process |
| `XDR_EVT_SUSPICIOUS_HANDLE` | 4 | Suspicious handle access (e.g., to LSASS) |

## Integration Points

### 1. Include Path Fix
**File**: `XDR/XDR.cpp`
- Changed from `#include "DriverManager"` to `#include "DriverManager.h"`
- Removed stub file `XDR/DriverManager` that was causing confusion

### 2. Driver Manager Lifecycle
**Initialization** (WM_CREATE):
```cpp
g_driverMgr.Start(hwnd);
```

**Shutdown** (WM_DESTROY):
```cpp
g_driverMgr.Stop();
```

### 3. Event Flow
1. Kernel driver captures events in callbacks
2. Events stored in ring buffer (`XDR_MAX_EVENTS` = 1024)
3. User-mode polls via `DeviceIoControl` every 250ms
4. DriverManager formats events and posts to UI thread
5. Events displayed in Events list or Alerts list based on type

### 4. UI Integration

#### Status Bar Display
The driver status is now displayed in the status bar:
- **Active**: "Driver: ✓ Active" (when driver is loaded and responding)
- **Inactive**: "Driver: ○ Inactive" (when driver is not available)

Status bar layout (5 sections):
1. Event/Alert counts
2. Collection state
3. Queue statistics
4. **Driver status** (NEW)
5. Theme

#### Event Formatting
Events are prefixed with type indicators:
- `[HH:MM:SS.mmm] KPROC START` - Process creation
- `[HH:MM:SS.mmm] KPROC STOP` - Process exit
- `[HH:MM:SS.mmm] KIMG LOAD` - Image/DLL load
- `[HH:MM:SS.mmm] ALERT KernelHandleAccess` - Suspicious handle operation

## Graceful Degradation

The driver integration is designed to work **optionally**:
- If the driver is not installed, FalconXDR continues to function normally
- Only user-mode telemetry is available without the driver
- The DriverManager silently fails after 5 retry attempts (500ms each)
- `IsActive()` returns `false` when driver is unavailable
- UI shows "Driver: ○ Inactive" status

## Benefits

### With Kernel Driver
- **Early Detection**: Catch malicious activity before user-mode APIs are called
- **Tamper Resistance**: Cannot be easily bypassed by user-mode rootkits
- **LSASS Protection**: Detect credential dumping attempts via handle monitoring
- **Complete Visibility**: See all process and DLL activity system-wide
- **Reflective Loading Detection**: Detect DLLs loaded via reflective techniques

### Without Kernel Driver
- **User-Mode Monitoring**: Process Monitor and Network Monitor still functional
- **Memory Analysis**: Memory scanning and YARA rules continue to work
- **Behavioral Analysis**: User-mode behavioral detection remains active
- **Reduced Privileges**: Can run without administrative rights

## Installation Requirements

### Driver Installation
The kernel driver requires:
1. **Administrator Rights**: Driver loading requires elevated privileges
2. **Test Signing Mode**: For development, enable test signing:
   ```
   bcdedit /set testsigning on
   ```
3. **Driver Registration**: Install using `sc.exe` or driver installer
4. **Code Signing**: Production drivers must be signed with a valid certificate

### User-Mode Application
The user-mode application works with or without the driver:
- No special installation required
- Will automatically detect and use driver if available
- Falls back to user-mode telemetry if driver is absent

## Security Considerations

### Driver Security
- **LSASS Handle Monitoring**: Detects credential dumping attempts
- **Altitude**: Registered at altitude `320000` (monitoring level)
- **Callback Filtering**: Only monitors specific process types
- **Event Suppression**: Duplicates are suppressed to reduce noise
- **Ring Buffer**: Limited to 1024 events to prevent memory exhaustion

### Communication Security
- **Buffered I/O**: Safe kernel/user-mode data transfer
- **No Direct Memory Access**: All communication via IOCTL
- **Validation**: Event types and sizes validated before processing

## Troubleshooting

### Driver Not Loading
- Check if test signing is enabled: `bcdedit /enum`
- Verify driver file is present and signed
- Check Windows Event Log for driver load failures
- Ensure no conflicting drivers (other security software)

### Events Not Appearing
- Check driver status in status bar (should show "✓ Active")
- Verify collection is enabled (should show "▶ COLLECTING")
- Check that events are not filtered out by search filter
- Restart application to reconnect to driver

### High CPU Usage
- Driver polls every 250ms - this is normal
- Large number of events may cause UI updates
- Consider filtering events or increasing poll interval

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the driver integration:
- [ ] Add network event monitoring from kernel
- [ ] Registry operation monitoring
- [ ] File system minifilter integration
- [ ] Thread creation/injection detection
- [ ] Driver-based memory protection
- [ ] Asynchronous event notification (vs. polling)
- [ ] Event rate limiting for high-volume scenarios

## Code References

### Key Files

- `driver/XdrDriverShared.h` - Shared definitions (kernel + user-mode)
- `XDR/DriverManager.h` - User-mode driver manager (header-only)
- `XDR/XDR.cpp` - Main application with driver integration

### Key Functions
- `DriverManager::Start()` - Initialize and start polling thread
- `DriverManager::Stop()` - Stop polling and cleanup
- `DriverManager::IsActive()` - Check if driver is available
- `DriverManager::Emit()` - Format and post events to UI
- `XdrDeviceControl()` - Kernel IOCTL handler
- `XdrPushEvent()` - Add event to kernel ring buffer

## Compatibility

### Operating Systems
- Windows 7 SP1 and later
- Windows Server 2008 R2 and later
- Both x64 and x86 architectures (driver must match OS architecture)

### Visual Studio
- Built with Windows Driver Kit (WDK)
- Requires WDK 10 or later for modern Windows versions

## Summary of Changes

This integration included:
1. ✅ Fixed include path from `"DriverManager"` to `"DriverManager.h"`
2. ✅ Removed stub file `XDR/DriverManager` 
3. ✅ Added driver status indicator to UI status bar
4. ✅ Verified structure compatibility between kernel and user-mode
5. ✅ Confirmed event types, IOCTLs, and symbolic links match
6. ✅ Documented complete integration architecture

The driver integration is now complete and functional. The user-mode application properly communicates with the kernel driver when available and gracefully degrades when it's not present.
